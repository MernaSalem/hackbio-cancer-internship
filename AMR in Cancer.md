**AMR in Cancer** (Antimicrobial resistance)  
AMR is a growing global threat to health and wellbeing. The WHO  [has stated that AMR is one of the top 10 global public health emergencies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance) we are facing.  
It  refers to the phenomenon where microorganisms, particularly bacteria, become resistant to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents.This poses a significant challenge in the management of cancer patients, who are often more vulnerable to infections due to immunosuppressive therapies like chemotherapy\[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000343)\].

*Relevance to AMR in Cancer:*  
Tracking Resistance Trends: By analyzing data from cancer patients, epidemiologists can track how resistance patterns change over time and in response to different treatment practices, guiding the development of more effective infection control and prevention strategies.

**AMR in Cancer Epidemiology :**  
studying the distribution, determinants, and outcomes of antimicrobial-resistant infections within specific populations, ex: cancer patients.  
This includes identifying high-risk groups, understanding how resistance spreads, and evaluating the effectiveness of treatment strategies.  
Cancer patients are at a higher risk of infections due to their compromised immune systems from chemotherapy, radiation, or the cancer itself.

The lack of knowledge of antimicrobials is a major contributing factor to AMR. Public Health England conducted a UK survey in 2017 to find out public knowledge on antibiotics \[[2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/antibiotic-use-and-resistance-what-the-public-know)\]. 83% of participants admitted that antibiotics could be used to treat bacteria and 35% of participants believed that antibiotics could be used to treat viral infections. These results have improved since the survey that was conducted in 2014, which indicates that the public in the UK has become more informed and educated about antibiotics \[[2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/antibiotic-use-and-resistance-what-the-public-know)\]. In comparison to a survey conducted in India, it was found that 49% of the respondents stated that antibiotics could treat viral infections and 45% of respondents use antibiotics for treating colds \[[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221339842100021X)\]. As a consequence, India was reported as having one of the highest rates of infectious disease, including those caused by multi-resistant pathogens \[[4](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/77/Supplement\_1/i10/6692265?login=false)\]. These studies indicate that there is a relationship between AMR and public awareness.

**Impact of AMR on Cancer Treatment Outcomes**  
**Bacteremia**  
the infection of the bloodstream caused by bacteria.  
high antibiotic resistance among bacteremia-causing microorganisms in cancer patients in a developing country. Resistance rates were higher among Gram-negative bacteria and especially among *K. pneumoniae* isolates. In addition, it presents the characterization of the principal genes responsible for resistant bacteria, among which *blaCTX-M* and *blaKPC* stand out in the group of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenems\[[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/11/2/359)\].
